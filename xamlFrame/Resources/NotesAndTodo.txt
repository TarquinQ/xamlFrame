Aims:
* Build a MainWindow that has a navbar on the LHS & content on the Right
* Display an icon & app name in top-left corner
* Display a selectable NavBar down LHS. Each Menu selection should consist of an full selectable label consisting of (icon+text)
* Clicking on a LHS menu item should result in content being displayed in RHS.
** LHS eleemnt should then show current-selection in some way.
* Each RHS element should consist of a header-banner + actual-content
* App should look like Fluent designs from UWP: see https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/xaml-controls-gallery/9msvh128x2zt for sample screenshots

App Behaviour:
* SystemTray icon should appear for this app
* Main Window should appear in TaskBar, but minimise solely to SystemTray
* App should have three themes - default (med.grey), light & dark. Ideally, this pref should be saved per-user, and reloaded on startup. This is completely optional.
* App should have concurrent threads (triggered either at startup or by button-press) that pop up Toast notifications.
** These toasts should have buttons should that do something.. but that may does not neccesarily require it to come back to main window.

Pages:
* Page 0: QuickLinks to things (web pages etc)
* Page 1: Basic User & Machine Info (names, model, serial, etc)
* Page 2: Machine Health
* Page 3: No idea yet

Health Page:
* Machine should get score x/10 (+ progress bar?)
** Disk space (SystemDrive): 2 points: <5GB free 0pts, 10GB free 1pt, 20GB free 2pts
** A/V Status: 1 point: Switched on & defns up-to-date
** Patches: 3 pts: 1 point if lastChecked < 7 days, 1 point if installed < 2 months, 1 point if oldestOutstanding < 2 months
** Reliability: 1 point: 1 point if reliability rating above x (low thresh.) for prev 3 months
** Battery Health: 1 point: Laptops: FullChargedCharge < 60% of Design Capacity  (Desktops: 1 point always)
** 2 points reserved

Not in score:
** Performance: Windows Rating
** Event Logs: Application crashes per hour?  Bad sectors, controller errors?
** Disk Drives: SMART rating?


* Critical things should be be flagged: <5GB space, AV off, old patches needed
* Charts: disk space, CPU usage, etc


Battery Charge PS1:
   $fullchargecapacity = (Get-WmiObject -Class "BatteryFullChargedCapacity" -Namespace "ROOT\WMI").FullChargedCapacity 
    $designcapacity = (Get-WmiObject -Class "BatteryStaticData" -Namespace "ROOT\WMI").DesignedCapacity 
 
    if ($fullchargecapacity -eq $designcapacity) { 
        Write-Host "Your system doesn't seem capable of providing accurate battery information`n" -ForegroundColor black -BackgroundColor red 
        Exit 1 
    } 
 
    $batteryhealth = ($fullchargecapacity / $designcapacity) * 100 
    if ($batteryhealth -gt 100) {$batteryhealth = 100} 
    return [decimal]::round($batteryhealth)
