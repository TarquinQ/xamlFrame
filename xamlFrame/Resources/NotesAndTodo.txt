Aims:
* Build a MainWindow that has a navbar on the LHS & content on the Right
* Display an icon & app name in top-left corner
* Display a selectable NavBar down LHS. Each Menu selection should consist of an full selectable label consisting of (icon+text)
* Clicking on a LHS menu item should result in content being displayed in RHS.
** LHS eleemnt should then show current-selection in some way.
* Each RHS element should consist of a header-banner + actual-content


* SystemTray icon should appear for this app
* Main Window should appear in TaskBar, but minimise solely to SystemTray
* App should have three themes - default (med.grey), light & dark. Ideally, this pref should be saved per-user, and reloaded on startup.

* App should look like Fluent designs from UWP: see https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/xaml-controls-gallery/9msvh128x2zt for sample screenshots
